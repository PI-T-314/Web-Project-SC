                            Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what
                            scares her more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for
                            Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are
                            higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in
                            their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.(Scholastic Press, 2009)

                            Katniss is a 16-year-old girl living with her mother and younger sister in the poorest
                            district of Panem, the remains of what used be North America. Long ago the districts waged
                            war on the Capitol and were defeated. As part of the surrender terms, each district agreed
                            to send one boy and one girl to appear in an annual televised event called, "The Hunger
                            Games." The terrain, rules, and level of audience participation may change but one thing is
                            constant: kill or be killed. When her sister is chosen by lottery, Katniss steps up to go in
                            her place.(Scholastic Press, 2008)

                            meltdown of her own? Or will he snap out of his computer craze long enough to realize
                            sisters can be fun, even without batteries? (Penguin Group, 2005)

                        "A clever, humorous story in rhyme. Charlie's techno-driven world comes to a crashing halt when
                        a thunderstorm causes a power outage. His mother advises, "You'll have to find something without
                        plugs to play./Read a book!/Clean your room!/Sing a song!/Model clay!" Uninspired, Charlie
                        finally remembers an old handheld video game, but the battery is missing. Desperate, he steals
                        one from his sister's talking doll and ends up in the time-out chair. Feeling remorseful when
                        the little girl starts crying, he seeks her out and the two have a grand time playing games and
                        pretending to be dragons and wizards. When the power returns, Charlie is ready to retreat to his
                        "handsets and bots" but decides that it might be fun to spend some time with his sister as well.
                        The hilarious cartoon illustrations are bold and appealing and depict the siblings' many
                        emotions with exaggerated clarity. While the mother appears only as a hand patting her panicked
                        son's head, the family dog is usually present, patiently enduring a hose-down from little Isabel
                        Jane or angrily reproving Charlie for hurting her feelings. Pair this tale with Glenn McCoy's
                        Penny Lee and Her TV (Hyperion, 2002) for a fun storytime during 'TV Turnoff Week.'"

                        "Charlie loves computer games so much, he never plays with anything else - so when the power
                        goes out, he's really in the dark. His desperate search for batteries involves his sister's toys
                        and some nasty behavior before he settles down to realize what's truly important in his life.
                        Deftly written by Suzanne Collins and nicely illustrated by Mike Lester, When Charlie McButton
                        Lost Power is refreshingly original and moving!"

                        "A computer-game addict temporarily turns into a raving lunatic when a power failure shuts down
                        his PC, and Lester is well up to the task of portraying his breakdown. He sends red-haired
                        Charlie, pop-eyed features wildly distorted with panic, dashing after an old gameboy, then
                        brutalizing his little sister Isabel Jane's talking doll for a triple-A battery. When this
                        behavior instantly relegates him to the Time-Out Chair, Charlie yells (captured in the art by a
                        gross-looking spray of red and yellow) at Isabel Jane, which sends her away in tears—but then
                        also causes him to reflect remorsefully on how much he actually enjoys her company. Once off the
                        chair, he seeks her out for a game of hide-and-seek. Collins tells the tale in loosely written
                        verse and leaves Charlie, as the house explodes with restored light, thinking that he might go
                        play with his sibling some more before plugging in again. Unlikely to work as behavior
                        modification, but young geeks may take a break from their screens to enjoy the over-the-top
                        art."

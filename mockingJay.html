                        "At its best the trilogy channels the political passion of "1984," the memorable violence of "A
                        Clockwork Orange," the imaginative ambience of "The Chronicles of Narnia" and the detailed
                        inventiveness of "Harry Potter." The specifics of the dystopian universe, and the fabulous
                        pacing of the complicated plot, give the books their strange, dark charisma."

                        ambitious is the way she brings readers to questions and conclusions about war throughout the
                        story. There's nothing didactic here, and sometimes the rush of events even obscures what
                        message there is. Yet readers will instinctively understand what Katniss knows in her soul, that
                        war mixes all the slogans and justifications, the deceptions and plans, the causes and ideals
                        into an unsavory stew whose taste brings madness. That there is still a human spirit that yearns
                        for good is the book's primrose of hope."

                        of "Mockingjay." And there's much to talk about because this powerful novel pierces cheery
                        complacency like a Katniss-launched arrow. Look skeptically at computer and television images,

                        Collins is absolutely ruthless in her depictions of war in all its cruelty, violence, and loss,
                        leaving readers, in turn, repulsed, shocked, grieving and, finally, hopeful for the characters
                        they've grown to empathize with and love. Mockingjay is a fitting end to the series that began
                        with The Hunger Games (2008) and Catching Fire (2009) and will have the same lasting resonance
                        as William Golding's Lord of the Flies and Stephen King's The Stand."

                        "Mockingjay" is without question the most brutal of the trilogy. Nobody emerges unscathed – very
                        bad things happen to everyone from fan favorites down to characters so minor a reader has to
                        pause and think, "Now, who was that again?" before recoiling in horror at their fate. Collins
                        doesn't take war lightly – her characters debate the morality involved in tactics used to try to
                        overthrow the rotting, immoral government, and they pay a high cost for those tactics. It is
                        also an entirely gripping read. In Katniss, Collins has crafted a heroine so fierce and
                        tenacious that this reader will follow her anywhere."

                        terrorist label. More maudlin than the first two books in the series, "Mockingjay" is also the
                        most violent and bloody and, based on the actions and statements of its characters, its most
                        overtly antiwar — though not so much that it distracts from a series conclusion that is nearly

                        "Throughout the trilogy, Collins has asked readers to consider heavy questions. What level of
                        violence is justified to achieve needed change? How much integrity can one compromise for a just
                        end? To what extent does responsibility to others demand sacrifice of self? How much control
                        does anyone have over the construction of self? Katniss is the ideal vehicle for this dialogue,
                        her present-tense narration constantly putting her own motivations and even identity under
                        scrutiny.It's not giving away anything to reveal that Katniss will be tested sorely, that
                        allegiances will shift, that heart-thumping scenes of combat will yield to anguished reflection,
                        that she and readers will find themselves always wondering just whom to trust, that she and
                        readers will lose friends they love. In the final analysis, this is exactly the book its fans
                        have been hoping for. It will grab them and not let go, and if it leaves them with questions,
                        well, then, it's probably exactly the book Collins was hoping for, too."

                        "What happens if we choose entertainment over humanity? In Collins's world, we'll be obsessed
                        with grooming, we'll talk funny, and all our sentences will end with the same rise as questions.
                        When Katniss is sent to stylists to be made more telegenic before she competes, she stands naked
                        in front of them, strangely unembarrassed. "They're so unlike people that I'm no more
                        self-conscious than if a trio of oddly colored birds were pecking around my feet," she thinks.
                        In order not to hate these creatures who are sending her to her death, she imagines them as
                        pets. It isn't just the contestants who risk the loss of their humanity. It is all who watch."

                        always simmers just below the surface, waiting to be more fully explored in future volumes.
                        Collins has written a compulsively readable blend of science fiction, survival story, unlikely
